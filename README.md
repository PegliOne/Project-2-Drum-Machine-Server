Step One Complete: Database set up and seeded (users, drumpads and sounds appear on the website correctly). Routes, controller and views set up for users, drumpads and sounds. A form partial has been created for adding sounds. The next step is to add more functionality (drumpad and sound CRUD systems, user log in / log out).

## Website Production Plan

### Step One
* Create a new Ruby on Rails project
* Design, create and seed a database with information about users, drumpads, sounds and how they're connected
* Set up the routes, controllors and views needed for the website
* Add the basic site layout to application.html.erb (navber, headings, etc.)
* Commit initial version to GitHub and edit readme file

### Step Two
* Add functionality related to the users (sign up, log in, edit details, sign out)
* Add functionality related to the sounds (add new sounds, edit sounds, delete sounds)
* Add functionality related to the drumpads (add new drumpads, edit drumpads, delete drumpads)
* Commit updated version to GitHub and edit readme file

### Step Three
* Apply permissions (make sure that users need to be logged in to use the site)
* Add basic styling
* Test the website as a potential user/admin to make sure everything works
* Deploy the website using Heroku
* Commit updated version to Heroku and edit readme file

### Step Four
* Add JSON files that the React app can access
* Modify the Drum Machine React app to make requests to the server
* Commit updated version to Heroku and edit readme file (copy this readme file into the readme file from the main project and add heroku link to the description)

### Step Five
* Review and optimise code wherever possible
* Improve Styling
* Commit updated version to Heroku and edit readme file
